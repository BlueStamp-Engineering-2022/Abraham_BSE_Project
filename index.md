# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was setting up and hooking up the Raspberry Pi and all the necessary components onto my tv. The heatsinks, the sd card, and the controller were all added to ensure that the Raspberry Pi was working. Instead of the Raspberry Pi Os software, I had to first download a different software called Retro Pie. With Retro Pie, I needed to download an Imager for Raspberry Pi. Raspberry Pi Imager automatically downloads a list of the latest versions of Raspbian supported by the Raspberry Pi. Raspbian is the typical Raspberry Pi Os software, the one I needed on the Raspberry Pi was Retro Pi. With the included SD card, I plugged in the SD into my computer and launched the Imager. The imager allowed me to set the Operating System to Retro Pi instead of Raspbian onto the SD card. With the OS imaged onto the SD, I plugged the SD card back into the Raspberry Pi and rebooted the system and Retro Bi booted up.

# Starter Project
  

My starter project was a TV Be Gone remote that could turn off any TV with a click of the button. I learned how to solder for my tv be gone project and used the soldering to install different components to the TV B Gone board, including the remote, the LED light to signal that it is on, the microcontroller which runs the code, 4 different transisters to control how much energy is transfered to the 4 IR lights at the end of the remote, which is used to fire off different frequencies searching for the TV's frequency to turn it off. I had difficulties figuring out the soldering and getting the battery pack to stay together with the remote because it kept falling off, but overall it was a fun project to make.
