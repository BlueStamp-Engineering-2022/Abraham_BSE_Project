# Fingerprint ID Safe
This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servoâ€™s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# Second Milestone

My second milestone for my Fingerprint ID Safe with Keypad was completeing the entire project. This was a long and tiring proccess because I had to put the entire project into the lid of my project, tape it all down and make sure it works, and move on from my the breadboard, and solder everything onto a perf board. It was really frustrating because I was really bad at planning things, so I would solder things onto the perf board, then realize that I need it somewhere else or I needed to do something first. So often I would velcro my perf board and my arduino onto the lid of my box then realize I have to solder something else and I'd have to undo the velco which was a pain to do. Also the wires would get tangled a bunch of times  because it was really messy and there were a lot of wires. Then, when soldering some joints together my soldering wasnt that good so that the soldering would fall offg eventually when i was doing other things. This happened to each joint about 3 times each so resoldering each thing was really annoying because without each joint it wouldnt work. So, besides

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone for my project (Fingerprint ID Safe) was setting up all the circuitry and all the neccesary components to the fingerprint sensor. For this project, I first used a breadboard to make everything easier so that I could easily change the wires if I was doing something wrong. I first setup the number keypad to the arduino and the breadboard. Then I attached the power switch wires, then the fingerprint sensor and the solenoid. After a while of figuring out the circuitry and stuff, I finished the circuitry and downloaded Arduino. I connected the board to arduino and got the code to work after a while, after managing to destry 2 arduino boards which was frustrating because I had the voltage in port connected while it was connected to my computer which fried the board. After figuiring outthe code and getting the program to work, I was almost done. The program waits for the power switch to start blinking which signals its on, which then I type in my password onto the number keypad. If the password I typed is correct, it would signal the the fingerprint sensor and the fingerpritn sensor would turn green and wait for a fingerprint. If the fingerprint I put matched, it would signal to the solenoid and it would push and push back, which opens the box. After that I needed to remove the breadboard from my project because it wouldn't fit in side the box.. So, I had to remove all the wires that connected onto the breadboard and I used a a perf board instead which I could solder the wires onto. This was a lot of work and was really confusing because I had to learn different things on how to solder different things onto the perf board, but I finished after a while. After that my project worked. Next step for me is to attach this circuitry to the board so that I can make it working in a box.

# Starter Project
  

My starter project was a TV Be Gone remote that could turn off any TV with a click of the button. I learned how to solder for my tv be gone project and used the soldering to install different components to the TV B Gone board, including the remote, the LED light to signal that it is on, the microcontroller which runs the code, 4 different transisters to control how much energy is transfered to the 4 IR lights at the end of the remote, which is used to fire off different frequencies searching for the TV's frequency to turn it off. I had difficulties figuring out the soldering and getting the battery pack to stay together with the remote because it kept falling off, but overall it was a fun project to make.
